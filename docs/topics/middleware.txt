Middleware
==========

Middleware is a framework of hooks into Broke's request/response processing.
It's a light, low-level "plugin" system for globally altering Broke's input
and/or output.

Each middleware component is responsible for doing some specific function. For
example, Broke includes a middleware component, ``AddressBar``, that adds
a fake address bar at the top right hand of the window with the url requested.

This document explains how middleware works, how you activate middleware, and
how to write your own middleware. Broke ships with some built-in middleware
you can use right out of the box; they're documented in the :ref:`built-in
middleware reference <ref-middleware>`.

Activating middleware
=====================

To activate a middleware component, add it to `myProject.settings.middleware` array.
In `broke.conf.settings.middleware`, each middleware component is represented by a string:
the full Python path to the middleware's class name.
For example, here's the default `broke.conf.settings.middleware`::

broke.extend(broke.middleware, {
    Common: {
        processResponse: function(request){
            ...
        }
    },
    AddressBar: {
        processRequest: function(request){
            ...
        }
    }
});

During the request phases Broke applies middleware in the order it's defined in
`broke.middleware`, top-down. During the response phases, the classes are
applied in reverse order, from the bottom up. You can think of it
like an onion: each middleware class is a "layer" that wraps the view:
TODO: da fare!!

A Broke app doesn't require any middleware -- e.g.,
:setting:`MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES` can be empty, if you'd like -- but it's strongly
suggested that you at least use :class:`~broke.middleware.Common`.


Writing your own middleware
===========================

Writing your own middleware is easy. Each middleware component is a single
Javascript object that defines one or more of the following methods:

.. _request-middleware:

``processRequest``
------------------

.. method:: process_request(request)

This method is called on each request, before Broke decides which view to execute.

.. _response-middleware:

``processResponse``
-------------------

.. method:: processResponse(response)

``response`` is the object returned by a Broke view.
This method is called on each response, right after Broke executes the view.


Guidelines
----------

    * The middleware class can live anywhere on your Javascript environemtn.
      All Broke cares about is that the :setting:`middleware` setting includes
      the path to it.

    * Feel free to look at :ref:`Broke's available middleware
      <ref-middleware>` for examples.
