Models
======

.. module:: broke.db.models

A model is the single, definitive source of data about your data. It contains
the essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing. Generally, each
model maps to a single database table.

The basics:

    * Each model is a Javascript class that subclasses
      :class:broke.db.models.Model`.

    * Each attribute of the model's fields represents a database field.

    * With all of this, Broke gives you an automatically-generated
      database-access API; see :ref:`topics-db-queries`.


Quick example
=============

This example model defines a ``Person``, which has a ``first_name`` and
``last_name``::
	
    (function(){
        var Model= broke.db.models.Model;
        
        Model.extend("myApp.models.Blog", {
            // Class init
            init: function(){
                this.app_label= 'myapp';
                this.table= this.app_label + '_' + this.name.lower();
                
                this._super();
            }
        },{
            // instance init
            init: function(args){
                this.fields= {
                    first_name: '',
                    last_name: ''
                };
                
                this._super(args, this.fields);
            }
        });
    });


``first_name`` and ``last_name`` are fields_ of the model. Each field is
specified as a class attribute, and each attribute maps to a database column.


Relationships
-------------

Relationships between instances of objects lies in simple arrays of ids or
just a field with an id.


TODO::

Meta options
============

Give your model metadata by using an inner ``class Meta``, like so::

    class Ox(models.Model):
        horn_length = models.IntegerField()

        class Meta:
            ordering = ["horn_length"]
            verbose_name_plural = "oxen"

Model metadata is "anything that's not a field", such as ordering options
(:attr:`~Options.ordering`), database table name (:attr:`~Options.db_table`), or
human-readable singular and plural names (:attr:`~Options.verbose_name` and
:attr:`~Options.verbose_name_plural`). None are required, and adding ``class
Meta`` to a model is completely optional.

A complete list of all possible ``Meta`` options can be found in the :ref:`model
option reference <ref-models-options>`.

.. _model-methods:

TODO::

Model methods
=============

Define custom methods on a model to add custom "row-level" functionality to your
objects. Whereas :class:`~broke.db.models.Manager` methods are intended to do
"table-wide" things, model methods should act on a particular model instance.

This is a valuable technique for keeping business logic in one place -- the
model.

For example, this model has a few custom methods::

    from django.contrib.localflavor.us.models import USStateField

    class Person(models.Model):
        first_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        last_name = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        birth_date = models.DateField()
        address = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        city = models.CharField(max_length=50)
        state = USStateField() # Yes, this is America-centric...

        def baby_boomer_status(self):
            "Returns the person's baby-boomer status."
            import datetime
            if datetime.date(1945, 8, 1) <= self.birth_date <= datetime.date(1964, 12, 31):
                return "Baby boomer"
            if self.birth_date < datetime.date(1945, 8, 1):
                return "Pre-boomer"
            return "Post-boomer"

        def is_midwestern(self):
            "Returns True if this person is from the Midwest."
            return self.state in ('IL', 'WI', 'MI', 'IN', 'OH', 'IA', 'MO')

        def _get_full_name(self):
            "Returns the person's full name."
            return '%s %s' % (self.first_name, self.last_name)
        full_name = property(_get_full_name)

The last method in this example is a :term:`property`. `Read more about
properties`_.

The :ref:`model instance reference <ref-models-instances>` has a complete list
of :ref:`methods automatically given to each model <model-instance-methods>`.
You can override most of these -- see `overriding predefined model methods`_,
below -- but there are a couple that you'll almost always want to define:

    :meth:`~Model.__unicode__`
        A Python "magic method" that returns a unicode "representation" of any
        object. This is what Python and Django will use whenever a model
        instance needs to be coerced and displayed as a plain string. Most
        notably, this happens when you display an object in an interactive
        console or in the admin.

        You'll always want to define this method; the default isn't very helpful
        at all.

    :meth:`~Model.get_absolute_url`
        This tells Django how to calculate the URL for an object. Django uses
        this in its admin interface, and any time it needs to figure out a URL
        for an object.

        Any object that has a URL that uniquely identifies it should define this
        method.

Overriding predefined model methods
-----------------------------------

There's another set of :ref:`model methods <model-instance-methods>` that
encapsulate a bunch of database behavior that you'll want to customize. In
particular you'll often want to change the way :meth:`~Model.save` and
:meth:`~Model.delete` work.

You're free to override these methods (and any other model method) to alter
behavior.

A classic use-case for overriding the built-in methods is if you want something
to happen whenever you save an object. For example (see
:meth:`~Model.save` for documentation of the parameters it accepts)::

    class Blog(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        tagline = models.TextField()

        def save(self, force_insert=False, force_update=False):
            do_something()
            super(Blog, self).save(force_insert, force_update) # Call the "real" save() method.
            do_something_else()

You can also prevent saving::

    class Blog(models.Model):
        name = models.CharField(max_length=100)
        tagline = models.TextField()

        def save(self, force_insert=False, force_update=False):
            if self.name == "Yoko Ono's blog":
                return # Yoko shall never have her own blog!
            else:
                super(Blog, self).save(force_insert, force_update) # Call the "real" save() method.

It's important to remember to call the superclass method -- that's that
``super(Blog, self).save()`` business -- to ensure that the object still gets
saved into the database. If you forget to call the superclass method, the
default behavior won't happen and the database won't get touched.

Executing custom SQL
--------------------

Another common pattern is writing custom SQL statements in model methods and
module-level methods. For more details on using raw SQL, see the documentation
on :ref:`using raw SQL<topics-db-sql>`.

.. _model-inheritance:

Model inheritance
=================

.. versionadded:: 1.0

Model inheritance in Django works almost identically to the way normal
class inheritance works in Python. The only decision you have to make
is whether you want the parent models to be models in their own right
(with their own database tables), or if the parents are just holders
of common information that will only be visible through the child
models.

There are three styles of inheritance that are possible in Django.

 1. Often, you will just want to use the parent class to hold information that
    you don't want to have to type out for each child model. This class isn't
    going to ever be used in isolation, so :ref:`abstract-base-classes` are
    what you're after.
 2. If you're subclassing an existing model (perhaps something from another
    application entirely) and want each model to have its own database table,
    :ref:`multi-table-inheritance` is the way to go.
 3. Finally, if you only want to modify the Python-level behaviour of a model,
    without changing the models fields in any way, you can use
    :ref:`proxy-models`.


``Meta`` inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When an abstract base class is created, Django makes any :ref:`Meta <meta-options>`
inner class you declared in the base class available as an
attribute. If a child class does not declare its own :ref:`Meta <meta-options>`
class, it will inherit the parent's :ref:`Meta <meta-options>`. If the child wants to
extend the parent's :ref:`Meta <meta-options>` class, it can subclass it. For example::

    class CommonInfo(models.Model):
        ...
        class Meta:
            abstract = True
            ordering = ['name']

    class Student(CommonInfo):
        ...
        class Meta(CommonInfo.Meta):
            db_table = 'student_info'

Django does make one adjustment to the :ref:`Meta <meta-options>` class of an abstract base
class: before installing the :ref:`Meta <meta-options>` attribute, it sets ``abstract=False``.
This means that children of abstract base classes don't automatically become
abstract classes themselves. Of course, you can make an abstract base class
that inherits from another abstract base class. You just need to remember to
explicitly set ``abstract=True`` each time.

Some attributes won't make sense to include in the :ref:`Meta <meta-options>` class of an
abstract base class. For example, including ``db_table`` would mean that all
the child classes (the ones that don't specify their own :ref:`Meta <meta-options>`) would use
the same database table, which is almost certainly not what you want.

.. _abstract-related-name:

Be careful with ``related_name``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are using the :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` attribute on a ``ForeignKey`` or
``ManyToManyField``, you must always specify a *unique* reverse name for the
field. This would normally cause a problem in abstract base classes, since the
fields on this class are included into each of the child classes, with exactly
the same values for the attributes (including :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name`) each time.

To work around this problem, when you are using :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` in an
abstract base class (only), part of the name should be the string
``'%(class)s'``. This is replaced by the lower-cased name of the child class
that the field is used in. Since each class has a different name, each related
name will end up being different. For example::

    class Base(models.Model):
        m2m = models.ManyToManyField(OtherModel, related_name="%(class)s_related")

        class Meta:
            abstract = True

    class ChildA(Base):
        pass

    class ChildB(Base):
        pass

The reverse name of the ``ChildA.m2m`` field will be ``childa_related``,
whilst the reverse name of the ``ChildB.m2m`` field will be
``childb_related``. It is up to you how you use the ``'%(class)s'`` portion to
construct your related name, but if you forget to use it, Django will raise
errors when you validate your models (or run :djadmin:`syncdb`).

If you don't specify a :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` attribute for a field in an
abstract base class, the default reverse name will be the name of the
child class followed by ``'_set'``, just as it normally would be if
you'd declared the field directly on the child class. For example, in
the above code, if the :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` attribute was omitted, the
reverse name for the ``m2m`` field would be ``childa_set`` in the
``ChildA`` case and ``childb_set`` for the ``ChildB`` field.


Inheritance and reverse relations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Because multi-table inheritance uses an implicit
:class:`~django.db.models.fields.OneToOneField` to link the child and
the parent, it's possible to move from the parent down to the child,
as in the above example. However, this uses up the name that is the
default :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` value for
:class:`django.db.models.fields.ForeignKey` and
:class:`django.db.models.fields.ManyToManyField` relations.  If you
are putting those types of relations on a subclass of another model,
you **must** specify the
:attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name` attribute on each
such field. If you forget, Django will raise an error when you run
:djadmin:`validate` or :djadmin:`syncdb`.

For example, using the above ``Place`` class again, let's create another
subclass with a :class:`~django.db.models.fields.ManyToManyField`::

    class Supplier(Place):
        # Must specify related_name on all relations.
        customers = models.ManyToManyField(Restaurant, related_name='provider')


Specifying the parent link field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As mentioned, Django will automatically create a
:class:`~django.db.models.fields.OneToOneField` linking your child
class back any non-abstract parent models. If you want to control the
name of the attribute linking back to the parent, you can create your
own :class:`~django.db.models.fields.OneToOneField` and set
:attr:`parent_link=True <django.db.models.fields.OneToOneField.parent_link>`
to indicate that your field is the link back to the parent class.
