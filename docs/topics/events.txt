   :synopsis: Broke events


The event system in Broke emulates the request/response system found in the
HTTP API.
Every time an URL change is triggered (wether through elements or hash changes)
and event named "broke.request" is triggered with various parameters just like
an HTTP request and every time a view returns something, an event named
"broke.response" is triggered.
This system lies at the base of Broke.


===============
Request trigger
===============

By default, Broke will attempt to attach a live bind event to every single
element specified in your settings.
Broke is highly configurable, so if you don't like the way it binds the request
event, feel free to find new ways to trigger request events.

For instance, you may trigger a request upon completion of an ajax operation,
like this::

    : $.get('/get/some/data/', function(data, status){
    :   myData= data;
    :   
    :   var request= {
    :       url: '/handle/my/data/',
    :       completeUrl: window.location.href
    :   };
    :   $(window).trigger('broke.request', [request]);
    : });

or even::

    : $.get('/get/some/data/', function(data, status){
    :   myData= data;
    :   window.location.hash= '/handle/my/data/';
    : });

in case you want to use "hashchange" event system, and let Broke handle the rest.
A new request will be raised and Broke will handle it appropriately, dispatching
it to the right view.

Consequently, I will now show you the difference between "elements" and
"hashchange" triggering methods.

elements
~~~~~~~~
This is the default behaviour. Broke, upon DOM ready event, will search for
every single element listed in "broke.settings.urlChangingElements" and attach
a function that will trigger a request upon different type of events that could
happen on an element.
For instance, Broke may bind to all the divs having a class of 'editing'
an "onmouseout" and "onclick" event a function that will trigger a request;
just set "broke.settings.urlChangingElements" like this::

    : broke.settings.urlChangingElements= {
    :   [...]
    :   'div.editing': {
    :       events: ['mouseout', 'click'],
    :       urlAttribute: 'data-href'   // html5 "data-" attribute
    :   },
    :   [...]
    : };

Broke will look at the attribute 'data-href' for the url to trigger, upon
"mouseover" and "click" events.

This type of request system is flexible compared to the "hashchange" since
you may let anything trigger a request upon any kind of event possible on that
specific element. You can let a "form" trigger a request and prevent default
action of the browser so that it will not be submitted to the server and handle
everything with Broke.

    : broke.settings.urlChangingElements= {
    :   [...]
    :   'form': {
    :       events: ['submit'],
    :       urlAttribute: 'action',
    :       preventDefault: true    // default action will be prevented
    :                               // so that the browser won't submit the form
    :                               // to the server
    :   },
    :   [...]
    : };

Please refer to the examples packed with Broke for a full understanding.
It is even possible to hide all the hash changes from the user, just set
"broke.settings.hideHash" to true and every single request will be transparent
to the user.

haschange
~~~~~~~~~
Hash change event is quite common place in all modern web apps, even though up
to Firefox 3.6 and IE8 has always been simulated with a frequent poll at the
"window.location.hash" property.
On old browsers, Broke simulates the hash change event polling every 150
milliseconds to look for changes and then trigger a "broke.request" with that
url. The request object will always get the same kind of event ("onhashchange").


pros and cons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
So far we've discussed how both the methods work, now I'll try to summarize the
pros and cons of both solutions:

    - elements:
    	- pros:
    		- you can bookmark the page
    		- more control over the event, since you can prevent default actions
    			on forms/links/whatever, like submit or visualization of the hash
    			on the page url
    		- every time you trigger a request, it gets intercepted by broke
    	- cons:
    		- the forward/backward buttons do not trigger any kind of events on
    			the page, so going backward and forward does nothing. So far 
    			I could not think of a good method to prevent this
    
    - hashchange:
    	- pros:
    		- you can bookmark the page
    		- the forward/backward buttons, changing the hash, trigger a request
    	- cons:
    		- poor control over the event happening in the page
    		- whenever a link gets tries to trigger the same event twice, it does
    			not get intercepted twice but just once (which could be good and bad)


=============
broke.request
=============

Whenever a "request" is performed, Broke will look at the url patterns to find
a match for the current "url" requested.
A request accepts an object of arguments with the following parameters:
    
    request= {
        completeUrl
        event
        type
        url
        fromReload
    };

Most of the times, you will not need to worry about this, since Broke binds
the right events to the page so that whenever the hash changes or an element get
clicked, depending on configuration, the right request gets triggered.
Whenever Broke finds a matching url, it will trigger the corresponding view
with the above request object as the first argument and an array of arguments
as the second argument. Please refer to "view documentation" for a full
reference.

From the top down here is an explanation of every single argument::

    - completeUrl
        This is the complete url performed upon request. For instance it could
        take this forms:
            - http://demo.brokenseal.it/#/blog/entry/view/1/
            - http://demo.brokenseal.it/#/blog/entry/save/1/
    
    - event
        The original event that originated the "broke.request" event.
        For example, if the "eventTriggeringMethod" setting is set to "elements"
        and the target clicked is an anchor, the event will be a "click" event.
        If the target of the operation is a web form, the event will be a
        "submit" kind of event.
        If the "eventTriggeringMethod" setting is set to "hashchange", the event
        will always be an "onhashchange" kind of event.
    
    - type
        Still not sure what to do with this, I wanted it to emulate a
        "GET"/"POST" protocol but I actually ended up using only GETs kind of
        requests.
        It's useless, just don't use it for now.
    
    - url
        The actual url used by Broke to match the right view.
            - /blog/entry/view/1/
            - /blog/entry/edit/1/
    
    - fromReload
        This is a flag which gets set to true if the "broke.request" gets fired
        upon page load/reload. It is sometimes useful to prevent some actions
        to occur upon page load/reload.
        For example, if a user bookmarked a page with
        "http://demo.brokenseal.it/#/blog/entry/save/1/" as the url, you do not
        want that to trigger a save event every time the user access that page.

==============
broke.response
==============

A response gets triggered every time a view has finished to process and returns
an object as response, so it is up to you to provide the right response object
suitable to your needs.
A typical response object may look like this::

    response= {
        operation: 'create',
        template: myApp.templates.entryView,
        context: {id: 45, objectTitle: entry.fields.title},
        method: 'prepend',
        htmlNode: document.getElementById('container'),
        additionalProperties: { style: "background:yellow;" }
        additionalMethods: {
            alertTitleOnMouseOver: function(){
                this.onmouseover= function(){ alert(this.innerText); }
            }
        }
    }

The difference between a server-side MVC/MTV engine and a client-side one, is
that the whole page is already there, rendered and you don't actually need to
update the whole but just pieces of it.
So, here is an explanation of the single parameters:

    - operation
        The single operation to perform on the page.
        Currently supported operations are: create, replace and update.
        The "create" operation renders the template with the given template and
        context variables and "append", or whatever the method of choice is,
        to the selected "htmlNode".
        Please refer to the single parameters and to the full example for a
        complete understanding.
    
    - template
        The template which gets rendered against the given context. As a result,
        a new node is created. Future references to this node will be named
        "newly created node".
        Please refer to the "Template documentation" for a full review of the
        syntax available inside the template.
    
    - context
        An object of parameters to pass at the render function.
    
    - method
        The actual method of choice with which the "create" operation will
        work against the given htmlNode. By default an "append" method will
        be given.
        Allowed methods are: after, before, append, prepend, wrap.
        "replace" method will use "replaceWith" and will ignore different
        methods supplied.
        "udpate" method will just ignore the method supplied.
    
    - htmlNode
        The "htmlNode" upon which the operation will work against.
        A "create" operation will "append" the newly created node
        against this htmlNode and an "update" operation will update this very
        htmlNode.
    
    - additionalProperties
        An object of additional properties to attach at the newly created node.
        For instance, ifyou need to attach an "onclick" and "style"
        attributes to the newly created node, you could provide an object like
        this:
            {
                onclick: function(){
                    alert('You clicked me! Ouch!');
                },
                style: "display:none;"
            }
    
    - additionalMethods
        An object of methods which will be applied to the given node.
        Please refer to the demos for a complete example.

Event dispatcher
================

Broke provides a :ref:`set of built-in signals <ref-events>` that let user
code get notified by Broke itself of certain actions. These include some useful
notifications:

    * :data:broke.nameOfYourModel.pre_save` &
      :data:`broke.nameOfYourModel.post_save`

      Triggerd before or after a model's :meth:`~broke.db.models.Model.save` method
      is called.

    * :data:`django.nameOfYourModel.pre_delete` &
      :data:`django.nameOfYourModel.post_delete`

      Triggered before or after a model's :meth:`~broke.db.models.Model.delete`
      method is called.


    * :data:broke.request &
      :data:broke.response`

      Triggered when Broke starts a request or a response.

See the :ref:`built-in signal documentation <ref-events>` for a complete list,
and a complete explanation of each signal.


Binding to events
=================

To receive an event, you need to bind a *receiver* function that gets called
when the event is triggered. Let's see how this works by binding a function that
gets called after each broke.request starts. We'll be connecting to the
:data:`~broke.request` event.

Receiver functions
------------------

First, we need to define a receiver function. A receiver can be any Javascript function or method:

.. code-block:: javascript

    function my_callback(object) {
        alert("My object has been save!");
    }
