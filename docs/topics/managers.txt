.. class:: Manager()

A ``Manager`` is the interface through which database query operations are
provided to Broke models. At least one ``Manager`` exists for every model in
a Broke application.

The way ``Manager`` classes work is documented in :ref:`topics-db-queries`;
this document specifically touches on model options that customize ``Manager``
behavior.

Manager names
=============

By default, Broke adds a ``Manager`` with the name ``objects`` to every Broke
model class. However, if you want to use ``objects`` as a field name, or if you
want to use a name other than ``objects`` for the ``Manager``, you can rename
it on a per-model basis.
To rename the ``Manager`` for a given class, define a class attribute of
type ``broke.db.models.Manager()`` on that model with the class initialisation.
For example::

	broke.models.Model.extend("broke.models.Person", {
        // class' init
		init: function(){
			this.app_label= 'blog';
			this.people= new broke.db.models.Manager(this);
			this._super();
		}
	},{
        // instance's init
		init: function(args){
        ...

Using this example model ``Person.people.all()`` will provide a list
of all ``Person`` objects.

.. _custom-managers:

Custom Managers
===============

You can use a custom ``Manager`` in a particular model by extending the base
``Manager`` class and instantiating your custom ``Manager`` in your model.

There are two reasons you might want to customize a ``Manager``: to add extra
``Manager`` methods, and/or to modify the initial ``QuerySet`` the ``Manager``
returns.

Adding extra Manager methods
----------------------------

Adding extra ``Manager`` methods is the preferred way to add "table-level"
functionality to your models. (For "row-level" functionality -- i.e., functions
that act on a single instance of a model object -- use :ref:`Model methods
<model-methods>`, not custom ``Manager`` methods.)

A custom ``Manager`` method can return anything you want. It doesn't have to
return a ``QuerySet``.

Modifying initial Manager QuerySets
-----------------------------------

A ``Manager``'s base ``QuerySet`` returns all objects in the system. For
example, given a Book model of a library app, the statement
``Book.objects.all()`` will return all books in the database.

You can override a ``Manager``\'s base ``QuerySet`` by overriding the
``Manager.getQuerySet()`` method. ``getQuerySet()`` should return a
``QuerySet`` with the properties you require.

For example, the following model has *two* ``Manager``\s -- one that returns
all objects, and one that returns only the books by Roald Dahl::

	broke.db.models.Manager.extend("broke.models.DahlBookManager", {},{
		init: function(model){
			this._super(model);
		},
		getQuerySet: function(){
			return this._super().filter({author: 'Roald Dahl'})
		}
	});
    
	broke.models.Model.extend("broke.models.Book", {
		init: function(){
			...
            this.objects= new broke.db.models.Manager(this);
            this.dahlObjects= new broke.models.DahlBookManager(this);
		}
	},{
		init: function(args){
			...
		}
	});

With this sample model, ``Book.objects.all()`` will return all books in the
database, but ``Book.dahlObjects.all()`` will only return the ones written by
Roald Dahl.

Of course, because ``getQuerySet()`` returns a ``QuerySet`` object, you can
use ``filter()``, ``exclude()`` and all the other ``QuerySet`` methods on it.
So these statements are all legal::

    Book.dahlObjects.all()
    Book.dahlObjects.filter(title='Matilda')
    Book.dahlObjects.count()

This example also pointed out another interesting technique: using multiple
managers on the same model. You can attach as many ``Manager()`` instances to
a model as you'd like. This is an easy way to define common "filters" for your
models.

For example::

	broke.db.models.Manager.extend("broke.models.MaleManager", {},{
		init: function(model){
			this._super(model);
		},
		getQuerySet: function(){
			return this._super().filter({sex: 'M'})
		}
	});
    
	broke.db.models.Manager.extend("broke.models.FemaleManager", {},{
		init: function(model){
			this._super(model);
		},
		getQuerySet: function(){
			return this._super().filter({sex: 'F'})
		}
	});
    

	broke.models.Model.extend("broke.models.Book", {
		init: function(){
			...
            this.people= new broke.db.models.Manager(this);
            this.men= new broke.models.MaleManager(this);
            this.women= new broke.models.FemaleManager(this);
		}
	},{
		init: function(args){
			...
		}
	});

This example allows you to request ``Person.men.all()``, ``Person.women.all()``,
and ``Person.people.all()``, yielding predictable results.
