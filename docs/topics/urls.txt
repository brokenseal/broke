A clean, elegant URL scheme is an important detail in a high-quality Web
application. Broke lets you design URLs however you want, with no framework
limitations.

See `Cool URIs don't change`_, by World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee, for
excellent arguments on why URLs should be clean and usable.

Overview
========

To design URLs for an app, you create a Javascript variable informally called a
**URLconf** (URL configuration). This variable is a simple mapping between 
URL patterns (as simple regular expressions) to Javascript callback 
functions (your views).

This mapping can be as short or as long as needed. It can reference other
mappings.

How Broke processes a request
==============================

When a user requests a page from your project, this is the
algorithm the system follows to determine which Javascript code to execute:

    1. Broke uses the object broke.urlPatterns which should be a Javascript 
       array.

    2. Django runs through each URL pattern, in order, and stops at the first
       one that matches the requested URL.

    4. Once one of the regexes matches, Broke imports and calls the given
       view, which is a simple Javascript function. The view gets passed a
       request object as its first argument and any values
       captured in the regex as an array of arguments.

Example
=======

Here's a sample URLconf::

	(function(){
		var news= myProject.apps.news;
		
		myProject.urlPatterns= [
	        [ '^/articles/2003/$', news.views.special_case_2003 ],
	        [ '^/articles/(\d{4})/$', news.views.year_archive ],
	        [ '^/articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/$', news.views.month_archive ],
	        [ '^/articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d+)/$', news.views.article_detail ],
	    ];
	})();

Notes:

    * To capture a value from the URL, just put parenthesis around it.
    * Javascript does not use named groups in regular expressions, only 
      positional groups

Example requests:

    * A request to ``/articles/2005/03/`` would match the third entry in the
      list. Broke would call the function
      ``news.views.month_archive(request, ['2005', '03'])``.

    * ``/articles/2005/3/`` would not match any URL patterns, because the
      third entry in the list requires two digits for the month.

    * ``/articles/2003/`` would match the first pattern in the list, not the
      second one, because the patterns are tested in order, and the first one
      is the first test to pass. Feel free to exploit the ordering to insert
      special cases like this.

    * ``/articles/2003`` would not match any of these patterns, because each
      pattern requires that the URL end with a slash.

    * ``/articles/2003/03/3/`` would match the final pattern. Broke would call
      the function ``news.views.article_detail(request, ['2003', '03', '3]')``.

What the URLconf searches against
=================================

The URLconf searches against the requested URL, as a normal Javascript string. This
does not include GET parameters.

For example, in a request to ``http://www.example.com/#/myapp/``, the URLconf
will look for ``/myapp/``.

In a request to ``http://www.example.com/#/myapp/?page=3``, the URLconf will look
for ``/myapp/``.

Syntax of the urlPatterns variable
==================================

``urlPatterns`` should be a Javascript array of an arbitrary number of urlPatterns.

urlPattern
----------

.. array:: [ regular expression, Javascript callback function|urlPatterns [, optional name]]

A ``urlPattern`` is an array with as first argument the path Broke will search against
to resolve the requested url, the actual Javascript callback function that Broke will call
whenever will find the exact match and an optional name.

You may put another arrays of ``urlPattern``, instead of a view so that you may modularize
your urlPatterns and specify them somewhere else in the code. 

See `Naming URL patterns`_ for why the ``name`` parameter is useful.

handler404
----------

.. data:: handler404

A string representing the full Javascript path to the view that should be
called if none of the URL patterns match.

By default, this is ``'broke.views.pageNotFound'``.


Notes on capturing text in URLs
===============================

Each captured argument is sent to the view as a plain Javascript string, regardless
of what sort of match the regular expression makes. For example, in this
URLconf line::

    [ '^articles/(?P<year>\d{4})/$', news.views.year_archive ],

...the ``year`` argument to ``news.views.year_archive()`` will be a string, not
an integer, even though the ``\d{4}`` will only match integer strings.

A convenient trick is to specify default parameters for your views' arguments.
Here's an example URLconf and view::

    # URLconf
    myApp.urlPatterns = [
        [ '^blog/$', blog.views.page ],
        [ '^blog/page(?P<num>\d+)/$', blog.views.page ],
    ]

    # View
    blog.views.page= function(request, args) {
    	args= args || ["1"];
        # Output the appropriate page of blog entries, according to num.
    }

In the above example, both URL patterns point to the same view --
``blog.views.page`` -- but the first pattern doesn't capture anything from the
URL. If the first pattern matches, the ``page()`` function will use its
default argument for ``num``, ``"1"``. If the second pattern matches,
``page()`` will use whatever ``num`` value was captured by the regex.

The view prefix
===============

You can specify a common prefix in your ``patterns()`` call, to cut down on
code duplication.

Here's the example URLconf from the :ref:`Broke overview <intro-overview>`::

    (function(){
    	var patterns= broke.urlResolvers.patterns;
    	
	    mySite.urlPatterns = [
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/$', 'mysite.news.views.year_archive' ],
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/$', 'mysite.news.views.month_archive' ],
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d+)/$', 'mysite.news.views.article_detail' ]
	    ];
    })();
    

In this example, each view has a common prefix -- ``'mysite.news.views'``.
Instead of typing that out for each entry in ``urlpatterns``, you can use the
first argument to the ``patterns()`` function to specify a prefix to apply to
each view function.

With this in mind, the above example can be written more concisely as::

    (function(){
    	var patterns= broke.urlResolvers.patterns;
    	
	    mySite.urlPatterns = patterns('mysite.news.views', [
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/$', 'year_archive' ],
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/$', 'month_archive' ],
	        [ '^articles/(\d{4})/(\d{2})/(\d+)/$', 'article_detail' ]
	    ]);
    })();

Note that you don't put a trailing dot (``"."``) in the prefix. Broke puts
that in automatically.

Multiple view prefixes
----------------------

In practice, you'll probably end up mixing and matching views to the point
where the views in your ``urlPatterns`` won't have a common prefix. However,
you can still take advantage of the view prefix shortcut to remove duplication.
Just add multiple ``patterns()`` arrays together, like this:

Old::

    (function(){
    	var patterns= broke.urlResolvers.patterns;
    	
	    mySite.urlPatterns = [
	        [ '^$', 'myApp.views.generic.date_based.archive_index' ],
	        [ '^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/$', 'myApp.views.generic.date_based.archive_month' ],
	        [ '^tag/(?P<tag>\w+)/$', 'weblog.views.tag' ]
	    ];
    })();

New::

    (function(){
    	var patterns= broke.urlResolvers.patterns;
    	
	    mySite.urlPatterns = patterns('', [
	        [ '^$', 'myApp.views.generic.date_based.archive_index' ],
	        [ '^(?P<year>\d{4})/(?P<month>[a-z]{3})/$', 'myApp.views.generic.date_based.archive_month' ],
	    ]);
	    
	    mySite.urlPatterns.populate(patterns('weblog.views', [
	        [ '^tag/(?P<tag>\w+)/$', 'tag' ]
	    ]));
	    
    })();

Including other URLconfs
========================

At any point, your ``urlPatterns`` can "include" other URLconf modules. This
essentially "roots" a set of URLs below other ones.

For example, here's the URLconf for the `Django`_ example provided::

	myProject.urlPatterns= [
		[
			"^/blog/",
			blog.urlPatterns,
			'entry'
		],
		...
	];

Note that the regular expression in this example doesn't have a ``$``
(end-of-string match character) but do include a trailing slash. Whenever
Broke encounters an object instead of a function or a string, it chops off 
whatever part of the URL matched up to that point and look for a matching in
that urlPatterns and so on.


Captured parameters
-------------------

An included URLconf receives any captured parameters from parent URLconfs, so
the following example is valid::

    # In settings.urls.main
    patterns('',
        [ '^(?P<username>\w+)/blog/', foo.urls.blog ],
    )

    # In foo.urls.blog
    patterns('foo.views',
        [ '^$', 'blog.index' ],
        [ '^archive/$', 'blog.archive' ],
    )

In the above example, the captured ``"username"`` variable is passed to the
included URLconf, as expected.

.. _topics-http-defining-url-namespaces:

Defining URL Namespaces
-----------------------

When you need to deploy multiple instances of a single application, it can be
helpful to be able to differentiate between instances. This is especially
important when using :ref:`named URL patterns <naming-url-patterns>`, since
multiple instances of a single application will share named URLs. Namespaces
provide a way to tell these named URLs apart.

URL Namespaces can be specified as the third item in the pattern array.
For example:

    [ '^help/', apps.help.urls, 'bar' ],

This will include the URLs defined in ``apps.help.urls`` into the 
namespace ``bar``.

Once you have defined namespaced URLs, you can reverse them. For details on
reversing namespaced urls, see the documentation on :ref:`reversing namespaced
URLs <topics-http-reversing-url-namespaces>`.

Naming URL patterns
===================

It's fairly common to use the same view function in multiple URL patterns in
your URLconf. For example, these two URL patterns both point to the ``archive``
view::

    myApp.urlPatterns = [
        [ '^archive/(\d{4})/$', archive ],
        [ '^archive-summary/(\d{4})/$', archive ]
    ];

This is completely valid, but it leads to problems when you try to do reverse
URL matching (through the ``reverse()`` method.
Continuing this example, if you wanted to retrieve the URL for the
``archive`` view, Broke's reverse URL matcher would get confused, because *two*
URLpatterns point at that view.

To solve this problem, Broke supports **named URL patterns**. That is, you can
give a name to a URL pattern in order to distinguish it from other patterns
using the same view and parameters. Then, you can use this name in reverse URL
matching.

Here's the above example, rewritten to use named URL patterns::

    myApp.urlPatterns = [
        [ '^archive/(\d{4})/$', archive, "full-archive" ],
        [ '^archive-summary/(\d{4})/$', archive, "arch-summary" ],
    ];

With these names in place (``full-archive`` and ``arch-summary``), you can
target each pattern individually by using its name:

.. code-block:: javascript

	(function(){
		var reverse= broke.urlResolvers.reverse;
		
		reverse('arch-summary', [1945]);
		reverse('full-summary', [2007]);
	})();

Even though both URL patterns refer to the ``archive`` view here, using the
``name`` parameter to ``url()`` allows you to tell them apart, even in templates::

    <% arch-summary 1945 %>
    <% full-archive 2007 %>

The string used for the URL name can contain any characters you like.
.. note::

    When you name your URL patterns, make sure you use names that are unlikely
    to clash with any other application's choice of names. If you call your URL
    pattern ``comment``, and another application does the same thing, there's
    no guarantee which URL will be inserted into your template when you use
    this name.

    Putting a prefix on your URL names, perhaps derived from the application
    name, will decrease the chances of collision. We recommend something like
    ``myapp-comment`` instead of ``comment``.

.. _topics-http-reversing-url-namespaces:


Utility methods
===============

reverse()
---------

Broke provides the following method (in the broke.urlresolvers`` module) to
reverse any url:

.. function:: reverse(viewname, args, urlPatterns)

``viewname`` is either the function name (either a function reference, or the
string version of the name, if you used that form in ``urlpatterns``) or the
`URL pattern name`_.  Normally, you won't need to worry about the
``urlconf`` parameter and will only pass in the positional and keyword
arguments to use in the URL matching. For example::

    (function(){
    	var reverse= broke.urlResolvers.reverse;
    	
    	reverse('arch-summary', args=[1945]) // /archive-summary/1945/
    })();

.. _URL pattern name: `Naming URL patterns`_

resolve()
---------

The :func:broke.urlresolvers.resolve` function can be used for resolving
URL paths to the corresponding view functions. It has the following signature:

.. function:: resolve(path, [urlPatterns, [args]])

``path`` is the URL path you want to resolve. As with ``reverse()`` above, you
don't need to worry about the ``urlPatterns`` parameter. The function returns the
array [view function, arguments].
