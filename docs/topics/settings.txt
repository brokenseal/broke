Broke settings
==============

A Broke settings object contains all the configuration of your Broke
installation. This document explains how settings work and which settings are
available.

The basics
==========

Here are a couple of example settings::

    debug: false,
    useAjax: true

Designating the settings
========================

When you use Broke, you have to tell it which project's settings you're using.
Do this by using registering your project, like this::

    var myProject= {
        managers: { ... },
        models: { ... },
        templates: { ... },
        urlPatterns: { .. },
        middleware: { ... },
        views: {},
        apps: {
            blog: {
                models: { ... }
            }
        },
        settings: {
            middleware: [
                'myProject.middleware.NextPageMiddleware',
                'broke.middleware.CommonMiddleware',
                'broke.middleware.AddressBarMiddleware'
            ],
            addressBar: {
                hide: false
            },
            debug: true,
            getLatestBy: 'title',
            installedApps: [
                'myProject.apps.blog',
            ]
        }
    };
    
    // project register
    broke.registerProject(myProject);

Doing so, Broke will import your settings and override Broke's global settings 
as well as register your url patterns. Please refer to the url patterns
documentation for more.

Default settings
================

A Broke settings object doesn't have to define any settings if it doesn't need
to. Each setting has a sensible default value. These defaults live in the
object :file:`broke.settings`.

Here's the algorithm Broke uses in compiling settings:

    * Load settings from ``broke.settings``.
    * Load settings from the specified project, overriding the global
      settings as necessary.


Using settings in Javascript code
=================================

In your Broke apps, use settings by using the object ``broke.settings``
Example::

    (function(){
        var settings= broke.settings;
        
        if(settings.debug) {
            // do something
        }
    })();

Also note that your code should *not* import from either ``global_settings`` or
your own settings object. ``broke.settings`` abstracts the concepts of
default settings and project-specific settings; it presents a single interface.
It also decouples the code that uses settings from the location of your
settings.
You shouldn't alter settings in your applications at runtime, it's bad practice.

Available settings
==================

For a full list of available settings, see the :ref:`settings reference <ref-settings>`.

Creating your own settings
==========================

There's nothing stopping you from creating your own settings, for your own
Broke apps, just don't reinvent an already-existing setting.
