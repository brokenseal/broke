Broke at a glance
=================

Broke wants to be a Javascript library to ease the pain of writing javascript
everyday. It inherits a lot (everything?) from the Django web framework (which I love)
and this very documentation is a rip-off of the actual Django documentation.
It allows you to write clean and organized code encapsulated inside an MVC/MTV
pattern.

Broke currently uses jQuery to manipulate the DOM and a couple of other stuff but
I'm actually trying to find a way to implement an adaptor for every major Javascript
library out there (.. _ExtJS docet: http://www.extjs.com/).


Model base class
=================

Broke uses the already written basic object .. _Class: http://ejohn.org/blog/simple-javascript-inheritance/
originally written by John Resig and then expanded by the guys behind .. _Javascript MVC: http://javascriptmvc.com/.
It provides good support for inheritance as well as Class static methods. I love it.


Enjoy the free API
==================

With that, you've got a free, and rich, :ref:`Javascript API <topics-db-queries>` to
access your data.::
for the next examples I'm expecting you to be using Javascript console::


    # You didn't post any entry yet
    : broke.models.Entry.objects.all()
    []

    # Create a new Entry.
    : e = new Entry({
    :     title: 'A new entry on my blog',
    :     body: 'Lorem ipsum etc.'
    : });

    # You may access to the original Class
    : e.Class
    Class()

    # And the original className
    : e.Class.name
    'Entry'

    # Save the object into the local database
    : e.save({commit: false})

    # Or save it into the remote database
    : e.save()

    # As soon as the server responds back, you'll be able to access the object id
    : e.fields.id
    1

    # You can access the object's fields through the "fields" property
    : e.fields.title
    'A new entry on my blog'

    # Now the new entry is in the database.
    >>> broke.models.Entry.objects.all()
    [Object fields=Object dataSetReference=Object type=Object] ([Entry object])

    # broke provides a rich local database lookup API.
    : broke.models.Entry.objects.get({id: 1})
    [Object fields=Object dataSetReference=Object type=Object] ([Entry object])

    : broke.models.Entry.objects.get({title__startswith: 'A new'})
    [Object fields=Object dataSetReference=Object type=Object] ([Entry object])

    : broke.models.Entry.objects.get({title__contains: 'new e'})
    [Object fields=Object dataSetReference=Object type=Object] ([Entry object])

    : broke.models.Entry.objects.get({id: 2})
    Object name=DoesNotExist ({name: 'DoesNotExist', message: "Entry matching query does not exist."})

    # Change an object by altering its attributes and calling save().
    : e.title = 'An old entry on my blog'
    : e.save()

    # Delete an object with delete().
    : e.delete()


Design your URLs
================

Broke.js encourages beautiful URL design thanks to flexible url patterns. To design
URLs you just need to extend the broke.urlPatterns property.
Here's what an url pattern might look like for the ``Entry`` example above::

    broke.urlPatterns.populate([
		[ "^/entry/view/([0-9]+)/$", broke.views.entry.view ],
		[ "^/entry/edit/([0-9]+)/$", broke.views.entry.edit ],
		[ "^/entry/delete/([0-9]+)/$", broke.views.entry.delete ]
    ]);

The code above maps URLs, as simple regular expressions, to the location of
Javascript callback functions ("views"). The regular expressions use parenthesis to
"capture" values from the URLs. When a user requests a page, broke runs
through each pattern, in order, and stops at the first one that matches the
requested URL. (If none of them matches, Broke raises a "NotFound" exception.)

Once one of the regexes matches, Broke calls the given view, which
is a simple Javascript function. Each view gets passed a request object --
which contains request metadata -- and the values captured in the regex.
Since Javascript doesn't implement (yet) named regex groups, you will only get
positional regex groups.

For example, if a user requested the URL "/entry/view/5/", Broke
would call the function ``broke.views.entry.view(request, [5])``.


Write your views
================

Generally, a view retrieves data according to the parameters, loads a template,
renders the template with the retrieved data and place it somewhere in the DOM.
Here's an example view::

``view`` from above::

    broke.extend(broke.views, {
        entry: {
            view= function(request, args) {
                var entry_id= args[0],
                    entry = broke.models.Entry.objects.get({id: entry_id}),
                    modalDialog= $('.modal-dialog[rel="' + entry_id + '"]');
                
                if(!modalDialog.length) {
                    modalDialog= $(broke.templates.modalDialog.render({
                        id: entry.fields.id,
                        body: entry.fields.body
                    })).appendTo('body');
                    
                    modalDialog.dialog({
                        width: 600,
                        height: 200,
                        title: entry.fields.title,
                        close: function(){
                            $(this).remove();
                        }
                    }).dialog('open');
                }
                
                return {}
            },
            edit: ...
            delete: ...
        }
    });

This example uses Broke's :ref:`template system <topics-templates>`, which has
a simple micro templating function called ``render``.


Design your templates
=====================

The code above loads the ``broke.templates.modalDialog`` template and here's what
that might look like:

.. code-block:: html+javascript

	modalDialog:    '<div class="modal-dialog" rel="{{ id }}">\
                        {{ body }}\
    				</div>'

Variables are surrounded by double-curly braces. ``{{ article.headline }}``
means "Output the value of the article's headline attribute." 

Note that you don't have to use Broke's template system if you prefer another
system. Each piece of Broke -- models, views, templates -- is
decoupled from the next.
